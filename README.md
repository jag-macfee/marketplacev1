# Marketplace Project #

## Readings ##

For now, we should focus on reading and knowing what's out there to work with

Here are some links (feel free to add more):

### Express.js / frameworks ##
*We will need to learn how to build an appropriate backend to run the marketplace*

Seems like express.js should be free and not too bad to learn

  * [This one](https://itemsapi.com/) looks potentially useful (Items API)
 

### Databases ###
*To store / retrieve store data we need to learn how databases work*

#### PostgreSQL ####

### Frontend ###
*We need a way to power the frontend*

#### React ####
React is pretty useful and relatively easy to understand for frontend work - requires some HTML knowledge too

### (Might be useful) Networks ###
*Might be nice to now a thing or two about networks - we will need this for tech interviews anyway*
